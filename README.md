# bachelorproef-demonstrator-site

## About

This site shows information about all the components that are used in the demonstrator board.
Pictures, explanations, videos can be found here.

This site is part of my thesis.

## Authentication

The site requires a login:

Username: **TestGebruiker**  
Password: **Test123**

## Try it out

[Website](https://nervous-pike-dfb37b.netlify.com/)

Install all dependencies and run the application:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

The site uses a rest api which holds the authentication and consumable data.
Which can be found [here](https://github.com/jensrott/bachelorproef-auth-rest-api).

The configuration files for my demonstrator can be found [here](https://github.com/jensrott/home-assistant-configuration).
